## Implicit Likelihood Inference - 1 mois 1 labo

A tutorial on Implicit Likelihood Inference was written for the "1 mois 1 labo" initiative at the Department of Astrophysics of CEA Paris-Saclay. A notebook is available [here](https://github.com/sachaguer/tutorials/blob/main/ILI_tutorial/1mois_1labo_sbi.ipynb). An incomplete version is also available to get your hands dirty [here](https://github.com/sachaguer/tutorials/blob/main/ILI_tutorial/1mois_1labo_sbi_gap.ipynb). A french version of the notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/sachaguer/tutorials/blob/main/ILI_tutorial/1mois_1labo_sbi_french.ipynb).
